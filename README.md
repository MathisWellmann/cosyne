# CoSyNE
Cooperative Synapse Neuro Evolution in Rust

## TODOS:
- randomly choose activation function from vec
- add bit-wise fitness just like the paper suggests
- Add more activation functions
- changing mutation probabilities and mutation strengths based on current generation
- multipoint crossover vs singlepoint crossover
- Set fitness threshold with config
